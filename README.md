This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Note
1. You will need to have create an [Onboardbase](https://onboardbase.com/signup) account if you haven't already.
2. You will need to create a project and add your environment variables on [Onboardbase](https://onboardbase.com/signup)

Firstly you need to clone the project 

```bash
$ git clone <project>
$ cd <project>
```

### `npm install`

This command is use to install all required dependencies that comes bundled with the starterkit.

### `npm run onboardbase`

This commands runs both `onboardbase login` and `onboardbase setup` at a go to make things fast and straight forward.

### `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.


## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) and [onboardbase](https://onboardbase.com).
